\section{Objectives}

This will be one to two paragraphs for each objective.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Numerical work; see if a fully implicit method gains anything when compared to the well-defined semi-implicit method (defined by Silca - Horvaat).
  \item Simulation work; Check if the model matachs other data; and if travelling waves exist; and if $\dot{p} = g(C)M$ can be used to match $CO_2$ production with biomass growth.
\end{enumerate}
