\section{Objectives}

There are three main objectives of this thesis:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Formulate and test a fully-implicit method for a highly degenerate, highly nonlinear coupled PDE-ODE system modelling \textit{C.thermocellum} biofilms. 
  \item Compare the fully-implicit method of Objective 1 with a previously introduced semi-implicit method, which it generalizes.
    This is done based on the trade-off between improved accuracy of the method and increased computational effort.
  \item Use the numerical methods developed in Object 1 and 2 to simulate \textit{C.thermocellum} biofilm formation on cellulose sheets, with the goal of understanding better the spatio-temporal dynamics of this system biofilms. 
\end{enumerate}
