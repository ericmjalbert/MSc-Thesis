\section{Objectives}

This will be one to two paragraphs for each objective.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Numerical development, implementation and validation of a fully implicit method
  \item The comparison fo the fully implciit method with the semi-implicit methods
  \item Simulation work; see if we can better understand the mechanisms of the bacteria by extracting some interesting observations from our simulations.
\end{enumerate}
