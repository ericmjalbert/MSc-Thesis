\section{Thesis Outline}

In Chapter 1 of the thesis, a brief background for the research project is provided.
The objectives of the thesis and the outline of how each objective will be addressed is also presented here.

In Chapter 2, the underlying model of \textit{C.thermocellum} biofilm growth on cellulose sheets is stated and transformed into a non-dimensional model.
This model is a coupled system comprised of a highly-degenerate partial differential equations for bacterial biomass and a ordinary differential equation for the growth limiting substrate.

In Chapter 3, a fully-implicit time-integration scheme is introduced that generalizes an earlier semi-implicit method.
The implementation of the method is discussed and validated by testing it against typical settings and running a grid convergence test.
Finally a comparison between the fully-implicit method and the earlier semi-implicit method is conducted.

In Chapter 4, the fully-implicit method of Chapter 3 is used to simulation \textit{C.thermocellum} biofilm formation on cellulose fibers. 
The numerical solution suggests that the model permits travelling wave solutions that describe the spatio-temporal breakdown of the cellulose fibers.
The results of the two dimensional simulations are compared qualitatively against a conceptual model of fiber breakdown and against lumped experimental data from the literature.

In Chapter 5, the general findings of chapter 3 and 4 are listed for.
A number of potential extensions are discussed for future works.
