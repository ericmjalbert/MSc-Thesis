\section{Background}

\begin{itemize}
  \item C. thermocellum biology and the connection to ethanol production. Look at USA data and the fact that C.thermo is a cellulolytic bacteria. 
  \item Talk about exisiting models for biofilms, such as: suspended cultures, reator scale-models, and Cellular Automata. %!% This one is not so much about existing models of biofilm but more on cellulose degradation by C.thermo
  \item Look at PDE with Volume filling and compare the model we will use here to the traditional biofilm model.
  \item Describe the Numerics of PDE's, such as semi-implicit methods and the different work that has been done to solve these kinds of problems. Mention the problems those methods would have with our system and mention where this work fits in. %!% Numerics of PDE is too general, what you want is numerical methods for such highly degenerate diffusion problmes or the particular biofilme model in genearl
