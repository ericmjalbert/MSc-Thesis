\section{Computational Setup}

The implementation of Algorithm \ref{alg:iterateCM} was done with Fortran. 

All the computations were run on a custom built workstation with an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2650 (1.2 GHz, 20MB cache size) and 32 GB RAM under Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5 (Santiago). 
Running the computations with OpenMP, took advantage of 6 out of the 16 processors of the Intel Xeon CPU, each with 2 threads.
The GNU Fortran compiler, version 4.4.7, was used for all computations; the compiler arguments were
\begin{verbatim} -03 -fdefault-real-8 -fopenmp \end{verbatim}



%!% Add other computers nd compilers to show that it was rigerously tested...
