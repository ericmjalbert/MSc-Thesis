\section{Implementation}

The implementation of Algorithm \ref{alg:iterateCM} was done with Fortran. The matrix system was converted into a 1D array by use of a bijective mapping defined as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \pi : \{ 0, \ldots, n\} \times \{0, \ldots, m\} &\to \{1, \ldots, (n+1)(m+1) \}
  (i,j) & \to \pi(i,j)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

% I have a figure for this?!?!?!?

The matrix was stored in diagonal format since $A$ is a five-diagonal matrix.

All the computations were run on a custom built workstation with an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2650 (1.2 GHz, 20MB cache size) and 32 GB RAM under Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5 (Santiago). 
Running the computations with OpenMP, took advantage of 6 out of the 16 processors of the Intel Xeon CPU, each with 2 threads.
The GNU Fortran compiler, version 4.4.7, was used for all computations; the compiler arguments were
\begin{verbatim} -03 -fdefault-real-8 -fopenmp \end{verbatim}
