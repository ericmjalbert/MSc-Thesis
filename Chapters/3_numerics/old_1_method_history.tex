\section{Method History}

This will be a history and literature review of the current semi-implicit method (semi-implicit euler?).
Mainly just refer to silca-horvaat and hermann's older works.

The traditional method to solving these types of problems is to discritize both equations in (\ref{equ:model_system}) so as to later solve them using the finite difference method as described by \cite{sirca2012computational}.
