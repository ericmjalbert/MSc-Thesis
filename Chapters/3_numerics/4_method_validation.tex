\section{Method Validation}

With a defined method and computational setup we assess the behavior and accuracy of the method in a variety of simulations.
An examination of a typical simulation will show if the expected behaviour is observed.
A convergence analysis for the method can be done to confirm that solutions from different grid sizes approach a single solution as they become more precise.
This convergence test will also show the thresholds for an accurate simulation result, to help reduce the computation times.
Once the fully-implicit method has been tested, it can be compared against the semi-implicit method.

\subsection{Basic Simulations}

Using Algorithm \ref{alg:iterateCM}, simple scenarios can be tested as a first verification on the method.

% Too simple/useless visual. Instead maybe have a graph of the standard deviation between gridpoints and show that it stays 0 (or constant?) with time.
%
%The most simple test would be homogenous initial conditions, $M = 0.1, C = 1 \forall x \in \Omega$.
%This test would serve mainly as a confirmation that the method can solve (\ref{equ:model_system}) with the most trivial of initial conditions accurately.
%The solutions in Figure \ref{fig:basic_homo} show that with homogenous initial conditions, the solution remains homogenous with time.
%
%\begin{figure}
%  \centering
%  \begin{tabular}{c}
%  \includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{basic_homo_t0} \\ 
%  (a) \\
%  \includegraphics[scale = 0.8]{basic_homo_t10} \\
%  (b)
%  \end{tabular}
%  \caption{Basic homogenous solutions, with $M = 0.1, C = 1 \forall x \in \Omega$. 
%    The solution stay homogenous with time, as seen by comparing (a) the initial solution at $t = 0$, and (b) at $t = 10$.}
%  \label{fig:basic_homo}
%\end{figure}


A simple test would be to check if the spatial discretization can preserve specific characteristics of the solutions.
One example of this would be seeing if a 1D initial condition could be preserved as time progresses.
Having all of the biomass on one boundary of $\Omega$, for example across the $y$-axis, would qualify as a 1D initial condition.
These initial conditions will be defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{equ:basic_init_trav_wave}
  \begin{aligned}
  M(0,x,y) &= \begin{cases}
    -\left( \frac{h}{d^4} \right) x^4 + h & \text{, if } y \le d \\
    0 & \text{, otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
  C(0,x,y) &= 1
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $h = 0.1$ and $d = \frac{5}{128}$.
Here, $h$ and $d$ represent the height and depth of the inoculation site. 

The solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:basic_trav} shows that the 1D characteristic of the biomass stays at a later time. 

\begin{figure}

  \label{fig:basic_trav}
\end{figure}

Another characteristic to observe would be if a spherical initial condition remains spherical.
Using initial conditions for the biomass,
\begin{equation} \label{equ:basic_spherical}
  M(0,x,y) = \begin{cases}
    - \frac{h}{d^2} \left( (x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 \right) + h  & \text{, if } (x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 < d^2 \\
    0 & \text{, otherwise}
  \end{cases},
\end{equation}
a test can be tried to see if the spherical nature of the solution is kept as time progresses.
We still have $C(0,x,y) = 0$ here.
The solution shown in Figure \ref{fig:basic_spherical} shows that the spherical shape of the solution is maintained at later times.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c c}
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{basic_spherical_M_t0} & 
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{basic_spherical_M_t40} \\
    (a) & (b)
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Solutions for $M$ with spherical initial conditions defined by (\ref{equ:basic_spherical}) at (a) $t = 0$ and (b) $t = 40$. Computed with a $1025 \times 1025$ grid and a time step of $\Delta t = 10^{-3}$.}
  \label{fig:basic_spherical}
\end{figure}

Both Figure \ref{fig:basic_trav} and Figure \ref{fig:basic_spherical} increase the confidence that the spatial discretization did not introduce any loss of characteristics for the solutions.
  
The global mass conservation may be lost from possible sources or sinks of biomass caused by the implementation.
To ensure this is not the case, the total amount of biomass can be used to compare the simulated amount against the theoretical amount. 
However, the total biomass cannot be exactly determined with the given growth rate function.
This means that there will not be anything to measure the validity of the simulation solution against.
If we let the growth rate be some constant, $a$, the exact total biomass can be calculated.

The expected total biomass, $T_M(t)$, can be found by using the divergence theorem and integrating over the region from equation (\ref{equ:model_M}) with $F(C) = a$,
\begin{equation} \label{equ:total_biomass}
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\partial M}{\partial t} &= \nabla_x(D(M) \nabla_x M) + aM \\
  \implies \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial M}{\partial t} \ dA &= \int_{\Omega}(\nabla_x(D(M) \nabla_x M)) + aM \ dA \\
  \implies \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial M}{\partial t} \ dA &= \int_{\partial \Omega}(D(M) \nabla_n M \cdot n)\ dA + \int_{\Omega}aM \ dA \\
  \implies \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial M}{\partial t} \ dA &= \int_{\partial \Omega}(\nabla_x(D(M) (0) \cdot n)) + \int_{\Omega }aM \ dA \\
  \implies \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_{\Omega} M \ dA &= a \int_{\Omega} M \ dA \\
  \text{Let }&\ T_M = \int_{\Omega} M \ dA \\
  \implies \frac{\partial T_M}{\partial t} &= a T_M \\
  \implies T_M(t) &= T_M(0) e^{at}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Numerically, this is computed by grid-wise summation,
\begin{equation}
  T_{M}(t^k) \approx T_{M}^{k} = \frac{ \sum^n_i \sum^m_j M^{k}_{i,j} }{nm}.
\end{equation}

%!% Also make FIG 3.4 a two-panel figure. One is the current plot and the other is the exact T_M and the numerical T_M, in logscaale.
% Also should probably set the xr for the current plot so that it is only in the region of good numbers.
% This time can be computed exactly, since I can a priori estimate from T_M(t), since I know that the maximum T_M can be is the total value of Omega??(namely M=1 everywhere)
\begin{figure}[!htp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.9]{basic_growth}
  \caption{Plot of the relative error, $\frac{|f_1 - f_2|}{|f_2|}$, between the computed total biomass, $f_1 = T_{M}(t)$, and the theoretical total biomass, $f_2 = y_0 e^x$. 
    The changes after $t = 8$ are from the biomass having completely filled the region $\Omega$.
    This means that there is no physical space for the biomass to occupy and thus the growth slows down to a stop.}
  \label{fig:basic_growth}
\end{figure}

The simulation setup used will be analogous to that used for Figure \ref{fig:basic_spherical}.
The one difference will be that the simulation here is ran for a longer time to allow the biomass to diffuse along the boundary, showing the boundary effects.

From Figure \ref{fig:basic_growth} we can see that the total biomass only differs between the computed value and the theoretical value by a relative error less then $0.003$.
The cases where the error becomes significant are from the region being completely filled with biomass, at which point diffusion is no longer possible.
The error fluctuates violently here because of this.
This suggests that the method does not introduce any significant sources or sinks of biomass at the boundary of the region.

%!% add mass -conseration between M and C by checking that $M' + \gamma C' = 0$; ie total mass is constant
  % Show here the pre-work of integrating over the domain and that the spatial term dissapers and all thats left is the growth terms in both M and C.
  % If its interesting, show a graph of M'+gama C vs. t, and try to explain/justify the changes it makes (unless its 0, then just report that its zero and say DATA NOT SHOWN.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}
%!%To validate the accuracy of the method, convergence analyses on the spatial and temporal discretizations will need to be made. 
To validate the accuracy of the method, convergence analyses on the spatial discretizations will need to be made. 
Then the comparison between the semi- and fully-implicit method established in Algorithm \ref{alg:iterateCM} can investigated.
First, a metric must be formed to enable consistent comparisons between different simulation solutions. 
This metric will be referred to as the normed difference. 
Only $M$ will be considered for the normed difference calculations.
This is because $C$ depends on $M$ and including it does not qualitatively change the results.

\subsubsection{Normed Difference Computations}

The normed difference is computed by taking the relative normed-difference between two solution in the following fashion:
\begin{equation} \label{equ:normed difference_comp}
  \epsilon_{sol} = \frac{||u_1 - u_2||}{||u_2||}
\end{equation}
where $u_1$ represents one simulation solution and $u_2$ references the solution that is expected to be more accurate.
The theoretical accuracy of $u_2$ derives from the fact that most comparisons will be done between solutions where one is trivially expected to be more precise.
For our purposes, the solutions we compare will typically vary in only $\Delta x$ or between semi- and fully- implicit.
These are understood to have the relation that a smaller $\Delta x$, and that the fully-implicit method with the highest tolerance is to be more accurate.
There is an assumption that both $u_1$ and $u_2$ have the same number of grid points, so that the difference can be taken grid-wise.
In the case where there are difference between the number of grid points of $u_1$ and $u_2$, the coarser grid point refinement is for both $u_1$ and $u_2$.
This is done by projecting the finer grid onto the coarser grid.

The results of the normed difference computations, named $\epsilon_{sol}$, is a numerical value for the difference between two solutions.
This depends on the norm used during the computations.
%!% l.552-556:  be mindful of the index range of \sum and \max
Here three norms will be used:
\begin{equation}  \label{equ:norm_l1}
  \ell_1: ||u||_1 = \frac{1}{nm} \sum_{i}^{nm} |u_{i}|
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}  \label{equ:norm_l2}
  \ell_2: ||u||_2 = \frac{1}{nm} \sqrt{\sum_{i}^{nm} (u_{i})^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}  \label{equ:norm_linf}
  \ell_\infty: ||u||_\infty = \max_{i=1,\ldots,nm} |u_{i}|
\end{equation}
These different norms will all be used to create a broader understanding of the normed difference.
This creates three distinct values for $\epsilon_{sol}$, named $\epsilon_{\ell_1}$, $\epsilon_{\ell_2}$, and $\epsilon_{\ell_\infty}$; each named for the norm used during the computation.
Note that these norms are for the vector of the solution, through the use of the grid-ordering $\pi(i,j)$.
  
%!% \item What program did I use? (R probably....)
%!% Also mention the Accuracy of the solutions by using the norm of each solution compared to the  most accurate one.... (Maybe take a solution at a higher grid resolution?, not sure what to do here)

\subsubsection{Grid Size Convergence}
To observe the validity of the method, a test on the convergence of solutions based on the spatial discretization is done.
This will involve using the same simulation described in (\ref{equ:basic_init_trav_wave}) due to the simplicity. 

The convergence will be tracked with only two forms of $\epsilon_{sol}$; $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$.
%!% Might as well include the values of \epsilon_infty in with the results and discuss why it isn't a good measure in the cases where it blatently looks bad.
This is because the value of $\epsilon_{\infty}$ does not vary with the grid size, since the wave front has a steep interface and tends to lead to inconsistent changes in normed difference.
Since the use of $\epsilon_{\infty}$ is not a suitable method for measuring the normed difference, the inconsistency does not suggest an invalidity with the method.
Because of the difference in the number of grid points between different solutions, $u_1$ and $u_2$, only the grid points in the coarser refinement will be used.
This places a limitation on the selection of grid-sizes since there must be some grid points locations that are the same for two different chosen grid sizes.
%!% l.572  i don't think you ever defined what s(n) is and what it is used for... how does the grid size depend on s(n)?
% I think he means that I don't mention where s(n) fits into the grand scheme...
For this purpose, we define the function $s(n) = 2^{n}+1$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ to be used as the grid size selection function.
Now certain grid points will match without the use of linear interpolation, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:grid_point_lineup}.

 Using the same simulation setup as was done in Figure (\ref{fig:basic_trav}), solutions resulting from different grid sizes based on $s(n)$ are computed for $n = 5, 6, \ldots, 12$.
 In this case, when calculating $\epsilon_{sol} = \frac{| u_1 - u_2 |}{|u_2|}$, we let $u_1$ be the grid size under investigation and $u_2$ be the solutions of the most refined grid size, $n = 12$.
 This would show the converging solutions for smaller grid sizes because the change to the finest grid size will be monotonically decreasing.

 The results from Figure \ref{fig:converge_spatial} show that the solutions converge as the grid size become refined with the grid size.
 %!% Hermann: "this Does not make sense":----> The non-monotonicity for $n = 5$ is because the grid has become too large for predictable calculations, which is an acceptable error since such a coarse grid would never be used for computational simulations.
