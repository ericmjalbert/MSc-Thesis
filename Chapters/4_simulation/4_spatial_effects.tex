\section{Spatial Effects}

This will be a quick section that goes through:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A quick blerb on what the spatial effects could be and what they can effect. The idea here is that if there are no spatial effects then you can efficently ignore spatial terms and further simplify the model in the future?
  \item Go through the test. Either do two vastly different spatial initial conditions (clumped in a coner vs. uniform distribution). OR the other option (harder but might be cool) is to run many simulations 10+ and show how the total biomass/ wave propgation/ co2 production  changes between them (either it does or doesn't....). Or be really intense and run 30+ simulations and now I have a sample to run statistical analysis on with R.... Not sure about the last one.
  \item Should be a relativly short section.
\end{itemize}
