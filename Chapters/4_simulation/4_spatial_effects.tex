\section{Spatial Effects}

This will be a quick section that goes through:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A quick blerb on what the spatial effects could be and what they can effect. The idea here is that if there are no spatial effects then you can efficently ignore spatial terms and further simplify the model in the future?
  \item Go through the test of showing how two IC that differ spatially (clumped in a corner vs. uniform distribution on one side) talk about the results.
\end{itemize}
