%!%  \item What could have been changed/improved/explored/avoided? 
%    How could the change be made?
%    What could this gain?
%    What possible challenges could this change make?

\begin{itemize}

  \item A fully travelling wave analysis could be conducted.
    The existence of travelling wave solutions might be proven and the travelling wave speed could be solved for in dependence of parameters.
    The issue with this is the high degeneracy of the diffusion term.
    One way of handling this would be to try regularising the system to eliminate the degeneracy.

  \item The reaction parameters of the diffusion-reaction model from the experimental data in \cite{dumitrache2015mathematicalModeling} could be determined.
    This is an ill-posed problem since the data is lumped for only $CO_2$ production rates; there is no data for $C$, $M$, and any initial data for $M$. 

  \item The two dimensional model can be upscaled to obtain a reactor-scale model as in \cite{dumitrache2015mathematicalModeling} where the spatial effects were accounted for by introducing the concept of a carrying capacity.
    This could be accomplished by using volume averaging to consolidate the spatial terms in with the growth terms.

  \item A rigorous proof could be attempted, showing that the nonlinear iteration of the fully-implicit method always converges or that the conditions required for convergence is so far missing

\end{itemize}
