\section{Future Work}

This will be a quick section.
Mainly have bullet point paragraphs again (like in "lessons learned")
Each bullet paragraph will have:

\begin{itemize}
  \item What could have been changed/improved/explored/avoided?
  \item How could the change be made?
  \item What could this gain?
  \item What possible challenges could this change make?
\end{itemize}

The focus of this section should be for the \textit{non-trivial} points. That is unless it is too difficult to find good points.
