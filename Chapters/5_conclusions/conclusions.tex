There will be lots of concluding statements in here.

\subsection{Numerics}
   The numerical simultating of this problem can be solved in many differenct manners.
   Using the fully-implicit method as described in Algorithm \ref{alg:iterateCM} allows for an extra degree of accuracy for the solution.
   That being said, the difference in computation time is not neccessarily worth the increased workload.
   The semi-implicit method has shown to provide solution that are sufficiently accurate and thus the extra computations for the fully-implicit method are not always needed.
   The choice of method is mostly dependent on the problem that is being solved and the required accuracy of the solution.
   With powerful computers becoming more readily available, the sacrifice of computation speed becomes a smaller price.
