\section{Lessons Learned}

From completing each of the main objectives, some meaningful lessons can be taken from the results:

\begin{itemize}
%  \item What is the main idea of the lesson? From method formulation/validation
%    Where did we learn this from?
%    How does this help things?
  \item From the numerics chapter of the thesis, the validity and usefulness of a newly developed fully-implicit method was investigated.
    By comparing it to the standard semi-implicit method for which it is an extension of it was determined that a significant accuracy gain results from a single extra iteration of the fully-implicit method.
    Multiple iterations increase this gain since the increase in accuracy is positivly correlated to the number of iterations performed.
    However, the computational effort required from the fully-implicit method grows exponentially with higher tolerance.
    The best ratio for solution accuracy when weighed against heavier computation times suggests that two iterations of the fully-implicit method is best (one extra from the semi-implicit method).
    This resulted in an extra digit of accuracy at the cost of approximatly $150\%$ the computational effort.
  \item From the simulation chapter of the thesis, a number of useful characteristics were observed in the system.
    The existance of travelling wave solutions was strongly suggested from all the evidence gathered.
    The stabilty of this wave suggests that it always exists, but this cannot be verified due to the analyitic complexity of the problem.
    Testing two spatially different simulations and measuring the $CO_2$ production showed a large difference between the two solutions at a reactor-scale.
    This suggests that two dimensional models are better for accurately mimicing the behaviour of the system.
