\section{Lessons Learned}
This is be a series of bullet point paragraphs with each bullet having a lesson learned.

\begin{itemize}
  \item So the idea is for each paragraph to have 3-4 sentences that open with main idea of the lessson. Then it can go into what the actual lesson was. Followed by what result gave this lesson. And then finish up with how this lesson will actually help with things.
  \item There should be a lesson for each of the main ideas discussed in this thesis. So for the numerics there should be a lesson on the comparison of semi- and fully-implicit methods. For the simulation there should be a number of results. 
\end{itemize}
