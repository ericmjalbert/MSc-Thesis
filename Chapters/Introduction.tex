In here will be a bunch of info on the literature of biofilm simulations, and probably should mention the cellular automata model of C.Thermocellum in here and how this is mainly trying to make a continuous model of that simulation. 

Add also how that the existance of a travelling wave solution will be looked for, but not proven.... and how we will also try to model the growth of C.thermocellum based on the production of CO2.
