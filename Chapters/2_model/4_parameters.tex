\section{Parameters}

Each of the dimensionless parameters in (\ref{equ:model_functions}) have a biological representation based on the transformations done.
The parameter $\delta$ is the dimensionaless constant for diffusion.
It affects the change in biomass from adjacent biomass sources, a greater $\delta$ results in a greater change.
The parameter $\kappa$ is the half-saturation point, it is exactly the value for which substrait concentration results in $0.5$-optimum growth rate.
Parameter $\nu$ is the death rate of the biomass.
Specifically, it is the ratio of biomass growth to death, representing the fraction of biomass density that perishs from natural causes or a lack of substrait.
Lastly, $\gamma$ is the yield ratio.
It signifies the ratio of substrait consumed to biomass growth.
Here, a larger $\gamma$ value results in more substrait being consumed to  produce the same amount of biomass. 

With (\ref{equ:model_system}) being reduced to four parameters the numerical analysis become more simiplified while still retaining the same significance in results.
