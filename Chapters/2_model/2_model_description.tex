\section{Model Description}
The model used for simulations is based on the deterministic biofilm model developed in \cite{eberl2001deterministic}, which was designed for modelling the development of spatially heterogenous biofilm structures.
They modelled the biomass density and nutrient concentration as a two-PDE-coupled system.
Here the spatial diffusion of the nutrient concetration is removed to mimic the carbon fiberous substrate that \textit{C.Thermocellum} consumes in growth. 

With that modification, a PDE-ODE-coupled system can be purposed as,
\begin{align} 
   M_t &= \nabla_x \left( d(M) \nabla_x M \right) + f(C) M \label{equ:model_M}\\
   C_t &= -g(C) M \label{equ:model_C}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation} \label{equ:model_d}
  d(M) = d \frac{M^\alpha}{(1-M)^\beta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{equ:model_f}
  f(C) = u \frac{C}{k + C} - n 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{equ:model_g}
  g(C) = y \frac{C}{k + C}
\end{equation}
Here we have a pair of equations, (\ref{equ:model_M}) and (\ref{equ:model_C}), that represent the biomass density and substrate concentration respectivly.
The spatial diffusion of the biofilm is modelled with density-dependent diffusion, represented by (\ref{equ:model_d}), and the growth rate of biomass is given by (\ref{equ:model_f}).
The growth rate is simple Monod kinetic growth with a constant death rate.
In (\ref{equ:model_C}) there is only a consumption term from the bacteria consuming the carbon substrate. This term is based on the growth of the biomass, differing only by a scalar multiplier.
